# Simple To Do App - Success Criteria

## Overview
This document defines what success looks like for the Simple To Do App **Proof of Concept**, building on the vision outlined in `0_vision.md`.

## Target Level: Proof of Concept
This is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** implementation focused on validating core functionality and user workflow. The goal is to demonstrate feasibility and gather initial feedback, not to create a production-ready application.

## Primary Success Metric
**User Success:** Users can reliably capture and complete their tasks without forgetting important items.

## PoC Success Criteria

### Core Features (PoC Must Have)
- ✅ Add new tasks quickly
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete when finished  
- ✅ Remove completed or unwanted tasks
- ✅ Basic persistence (localStorage acceptable for PoC)

### PoC User Experience Goals

#### Speed & Efficiency (Simplified for PoC)
- Quick task capture (aim for intuitive workflow)
- Simple task completion mechanism
- Minimal steps to add/remove tasks
- No setup required

#### Simplicity (PoC Focus)
- Basic, functional interface
- Clear visual distinction between active and completed tasks
- Works in modern web browsers
- Immediate functionality without configuration

#### Reliability (PoC Level)
- Tasks persist in browser localStorage
- Basic functionality works consistently
- No critical errors during normal use

## User Journey Success

### Jessica's Success Story
*"I can quickly jot down 'call dentist' while making lunch, check off 'pick up batteries' at the store, and see my remaining tasks at a glance between activities."*

#### Key Moments
1. **Task Capture:** While hands are full, can quickly add task with minimal interaction
2. **Task Review:** Between activities, can scan remaining tasks in seconds
3. **Task Completion:** One tap to mark complete and remove from active list
4. **Return Usage:** Tasks are still there when she comes back later

## PoC Technical Success Criteria

### Performance (PoC Acceptable)
- App loads reasonably fast in modern browsers
- Task operations respond without noticeable delay
- Works on desktop browsers (mobile optimization not required for PoC)

### Usability (PoC Minimum)
- Single-page interface
- Functional on desktop browsers
- Readable interface
- Works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari

## PoC Failure Indicators
- Core functionality (add/complete/remove tasks) doesn't work
- Tasks don't persist between browser sessions
- Interface is confusing or broken
- Critical errors prevent normal use

## PoC Success Measurement
- Core workflow (add task → complete task → remove task) functions correctly
- Tasks persist when browser is refreshed
- Interface is intuitive enough for immediate use
- Demonstrates the viability of the core concept

## Beyond PoC
Future iterations could include:
- Mobile optimization and responsive design
- Advanced persistence (database, cloud sync)
- Performance optimization (sub-2-second load times)
- Enhanced UX (animations, better mobile touch targets)
- Cross-device synchronization
- Offline functionality
